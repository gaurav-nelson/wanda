CSS recently introduced a new feature called `layers` to the [cascade specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-5/#layering).

This important feature allows more granularity and control over CSS specificity and overrides, especially when discussing shared libraries and design systems.

Layers allow authors and Wanda consumers to define specificity layers independently from when a specific style appears on the page and the parsing order.

Here is a quick example, in the code belove, if we remove the `@layer reset` declaration the `p` element would be `blue`.
Still, since the browser parses the CSS placed outside any layer (implicit final layer) after all the styles coming from layers, the `p` element is `red` even if `p[data-blue]` has higher specificity.

```css
p {
  /* specificity of 0,0,1 - implicit (final) layer */
  color: red;
}

@layer reset {
  p[data-blue] {
    /* specificity of 0,1,1 - explicit "reset" layer */
    color: blue;
  }
}
```

## Wanda layers

Wanda defines 4 CSS layers, referenced internally inside the packages that compose the design system:

```css
@layer core, utilities, components, overrides;
```

Let's see a real example. The `Button` component declares its styles inside the `components` layer:

```css
@layer components {
  .Button {â‹¯}
}
```

Now, the `Snackbar` needs to override some properties of the button, but [we cannot use](https://s3.memeshappen.com/memes/i-will-find-you-then-you-will-pay-for-that-meme-8720.jpg) `!import`. Layers rescue us by allowing us to section the cascade in different layers of specificity. Now let's see what the `Snackbar` can do to solve this issue.

```css
@layer overrides {
  .Action {
    color: var(--snackbar-bg);
    background-color: var(--snackbar-fg);

    &:is(:active, :hover) {
      color: var(--snackbar-bg);
      background-color: var(--snackbar-fg);
      opacity: 80%;
    }
  }
}
```

Since we declared the `overrides` scope after components, it has higher precedence in the cascade and specificity computing. This way, the styles declared inside a layer `overrides` will win over the ones declared inside the layer `components`.

## Advantages for consumers

When consumers need to write down their styles and overwrite some properties, any CSS defined by the consumer in their projects will always win over the styles coming from the design system unless the user declares them inside a new and local CSS layer.
